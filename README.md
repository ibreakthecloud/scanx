# ScanX

ScanX, pronounced, "scan-ex", is essentially a simple filewalker implementation that provides a pluggable interface for any go-based plugins that operates on files.

It is under development and still needs a lot of work for the first version to work.

Default plugins that will come out of box:

- Deepfence / YaraHunter
- Deepfence / SecretScanner
- Filecounter
